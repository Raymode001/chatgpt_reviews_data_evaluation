### Data Quality Observations
- **No null comments** suggest that the quality of the scraped data is good for further analysis.
- The 'at' timestamps are currently in the format of object. For time-based analysis, they should be converted to datetime format.
- As shown by the data summary, the score for ChatGPT app is heavily skewed towards positive.
- thumbsUpCount is highly polarized, with majority of data valued at zero and the highest of data valued at 39058.000000.
- The sample covers approximately two years of review history and is very current, with the latest data from just a few days ago.

### 1. Score Distribution Analysis

![Review Scores Distribution](images/reviewscoresbar.png)

The score is skewed heavily towards extreme positive.

### 2. Time-Based Analysis

Average monthly score fluctuates more drastically in the early months, with major valleys, likely reflecting unstable performance with earlier updates. However, the overall trend stays steadily above 4, signaling general user satisfaction since the app was launched.

### 3. Language Distribution Analysis

![Language Distribution](images/langdistributionpiechart.png)

#### Top Languages Detected

| Language | Count |
|----------|-------|
| en | 4714 |
| so | 1203 |
| af | 667 |
| pl | 496 |
| ro | 382 |
| unknown | 267 |
| it | 252 |
| ca | 236 |
| fr | 151 |
| sw | 137 |

**Observation**: English content is the largest single language group. This sample strongly suggests that the full 1.2 million review dataset contains a statistically significant volume of English-language reviews (likely over 500,000). Focusing on English-only content is recommended in further sentiment analysis.

### 4. Review Length Distribution

![Review Length Distribution](images/reviewlengthhist.png)

#### Review Length Statistics (df_english['reviews_word_count'].describe())

|  | reviews_word_count |

**Observations**:
- The TextBlob polarity histogram is characterized by a large volume of neutral or mildly positive comments and a substantial number of clearly positive reviews. The scarcity of negative scores reinforces the high average star rating and indicates a satisfied user base.
- The analysis examples show that TextBlob is good at identifying overtly positive reviews but can struggle with recognizing the sentiment in more nuanced text, especially in negative reviews. Many reviews with strong opinions are given neutral polarity scores.
- The boxplot shows a strong positive correlation between user star ratings and the sentiment polarity of the review text, confirming the dataset's suitability for sentiment analysis.

## Key Insights

1. **High User Satisfaction**: The app has consistently high ratings with scores heavily skewed toward positive feedback.

2. **Multilingual User Base**: While English dominates, the app has a diverse international user base with significant non-English reviews.

3. **Concise Feedback**: Most users provide brief, direct feedback rather than detailed reviews.

4. **Sentiment-Text Alignment**: There's a strong correlation between the sentiment expressed in review text and the numerical star ratings given by users.

5. **Topic Diversity**: Topic modeling revealed 8 distinct themes including functionality, learning, student use, and technical issues.

## Usage

1. Run `chatgpt_reviews_scraper_notebook.ipynb` to scrape fresh data from Google Play Store
2. Run `exploratory_analysis.ipynb` to perform the complete analysis and generate visualizations
3. All charts and insights will be saved to the `images/` folder

## Data Quality Notes
